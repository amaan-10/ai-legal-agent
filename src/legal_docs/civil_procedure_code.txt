Illustration 
 The Plaintiff, in his  suit, seeks a  money decree  f
or breach of contract, and damages. The Court holds
 that the 
Plaintiff  is  entitled  to  the  money  decree.  However,
  it  returns  a  finding  that  the  claim  for  damages  is
  frivolous  and 
vexatious. 
In  such  circumstances  the  Court  may  impose  costs  on
  the  Plaintiff,  despite  the  Plaintiff  being  the  suc
cessful 
party, for having raised frivolous claims for damag
es.  
(

, even if that party has not been wholly successful
; 
(

) whether the party had made a frivolous countercla
im leading to delay in the disposal of the case; 
(
d
) whether any reasonable offer to settle is  made by
 a party and unreasonably refused by the other part
y; 
and  
(
e
) whether the party had made a frivolous claim and 
instituted a vexatious proceeding wasting the time 
of 
the Court.

g illegality. 
3. Denial to be specific
.
—
It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his w
ritten statement to deny generally the 
grounds  alleged  by  the  plaintiff,  but  the  defendant
  must  deal  specifically  with  each  allegation  of  fac
t  of  which  he

Where
 
a  defendant  denies  an  allegation  of  fact  in  the  pla
int,  he  must  not  do  so 
evasively,  but  answer  the  point  of  substance.  Thus,
  if  it  is  alleged  that  he  received  a  certain  sum  of
 
money, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he r
eceived that particular amount, but he must deny th
at he 
received that sum or any part thereof, or else set 
out how much he received. And if an allegation is m
ade 
with diverse circumstances, it shall not be suffici
ent to deny it along with those circumstances.

the Court may, in its discretion, require any such 
fact to be proved. 
(
3
) In exercising its discretion under the proviso to
 sub-rule (
1
) or under sub-rule (
2
), the Court shall 
have due regard to the fact whether the defendant c
ould have, or has, engaged a pleader. 
(

)  Whenever  a  judgment  is  pronounced  under  this  rule
,  a  decree  shall  be  drawn  up  in  accordance 
with such judgment and such decree shall bear the d
ate on which the judgment was pronounced.] 
6.  Particulars  of  set-off  to  be  given  in  written  st
atement.—
(
1
)  Where  in  a  suit  for  the  recovery  of 
money  the  defendant  claims  to  set-off  against  the  p
laintiff's  demand  any  ascertained  sum  of  money  lega
lly 
recoverable by him from the plaintiff, not exceedin
g the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the C
ourt, and 
both parties fill the same character as they fill i
n the plaintiff's suit, the defendant may, at the f
irst hearing of 
the  suit,  but  not  afterwards  unless  permitted  by  th
e  Court,  presents  a  written  statement  containing  th
e 
particulars of the debt sought to be set-off. 
(
2
) 
Effect of set-off.—
The written statement shall have the same effect as
 a plaint in a cross-suit so as 
to enable the court to pronounce a final judgment i
n respect both of the original claim and of the set
-off: 
but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount
 decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs pa
yable to 
him under the decree. 
(
3
) The rules relating to a written statement by a de
fendant apply to a written statement in answer to a
 
claim of set-off. 
Illustrations 
(
a
) A bequeaths Rs. 2,000 to B and appoints C his exe
cutor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out
 administration 
to B's effects, C pays Rs, 1,000 as surety for D; t
hen D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the d
ebt of Rs. 1,000 
against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the s
ame character with respect to the legacy as they fi
ll with respect to 
the payment of the Rs. 1,000. 
(
b
) A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out ad
ministration to A’s  effects  and B buys  part of the 
effects  from  C. 
In  a  suit  for  the  purchase-money  by  C  against  B,  th
e  latter  cannot  set-off  the  debt  against  the  price,
  for  C  fills 
two different characters, one as the vendor to B, i
n which he sues B, and the other as representative 
to A. 
(
c
)  A  sues  B  on  a  bill  of  exchange.  B  alleges  that  A  ha
s  wrongfully  neglected  to  insure  B's  goods  and  is  li
able  to  him  in 
compensation which he claims to set-off. The amount
 not being ascertained cannot be set-off. 
(
d
)  A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds
 a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims 
being both definite 
pecuniary demands may be set-off.

it.  B  may  do  so,  for,  as  soon  as  A  recovers,  both  s
ums  are  definite 
pecuniary demands. 
(

1
)  A  defendant  in  a  suit  may,  in  addition  to  his  rig
ht  of

counter-claim  against  the  claim  of  the  plaintiff,  a
ny 
right or claim in respect of a cause of action accr
uing to the defendant against the plaintiff either 
before 
or after the filing of the suit but before the defe
ndant has delivered his defence or before the time 
limited 
for  delivering  his  defence  has  expired,  whether  suc
h  counter-claim  is  in  the  nature  of  a  claim  for 
damages or not: 
Provided  that  such  counter-claim  shall  not  exceed  t
he  pecuniary  limits  of  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
court. 
(

nounce a final judgment in the same suit, both on t
he original claim and on the counter-claim. 
(
3

Exclusion of counter-claim.—
Where
 
a defendant sets up a counter-claim and the plainti

pen-
dent suit, the plaintiff may, at any time before is
sues are settled in relation to the counter-claim, 
apply to 
the  Court  for  an  order  that  such  counter-claim  may 
be  excluded,  and  the  Court  may,  on  the  hearing  of 
such application make such order as it thinks fit. 
6D.
 
Effect of discontinuance of suit.— 
If in any case in which the defendant sets up a cou
nterclaim, 
the  suit  of  the  plaintiff  is  stayed,  discontinued  o
r  dismissed,  the  counter-claim  may  nevertheless  be 
proceeded with. 
6E.
 
Default  of  plaintiff  to  reply  to  counter-claim.—
If  the  plaintiff  makes  default  in  putting  in  a 
reply to the counter-claim made by the defendant, t
he Court may pronounce judgment against the plainti
ff 
in relation to the counter-claim made against him, 
or make such order in relation to the counter-claim
 as it 
thinks fit. 
6F.
 
Relief to defendant where counter-claim succeeds.—
Where
 
in any suit a set-off or counter-
claim  is  established  as  a  defence  against  the  plain
tiff’s  claim  and  any  balance  is  found  due  to  the

  Court  may  give  judgment  to  the  party  entitled  to 
such balance.

istinctly.

Any
 
ground of defence which has arisen after the instit
ution of the suit

ss. 
2. Particular interrogatories to be submitted.—
On
 
an application for leave to deliver interrogatories
, 
the particular interrogatories proposed to be deliv
ered shall be submitted to the Court 
3

the said application]. In deciding upon such applic
ation, 
the  Court  shall  take  into  account  any  offer,  which 
may  be  made  by  the  party  sought  to  be  interrogated 
to 
deliver  particulars,  or  to  make  admissions,  or to  p
roduce  documents  relating  to the  matters in  questio
n,  or 
any  of  them,  and  leave  shall  be  given  as  to  such  on
ly  of  the  interrogatories  submitted  as  the  Court  sh
all 
consider necessary either for disposing fairly of t
he suit or for saving costs. 
3.  Costs  of  interrogatories
.—In  adjusting  the  costs  of  the  suit  inquiry  shall 
at  the  instance  of  any 
party be made into the propriety of exhibiting such
 interrogatories, and if it is the opinion of the t
axing 
officer  or  of  the  Court,  either  with  or  without  an 
application  for  inquiry,  that  such  interrogatories 
have 
been   exhibited   unreasonably,   vexatiously,   or   at   imp
roper   length,   the   cost   occasioned   by   the 
interrogatories and the answers thereto shall be pa
id in any even by the party in fault. 
4.  Form  of  interrogatories.—
Interrogatories
 
shall  be  in  Form  No.  2  in  Appendix  C,  with  such

officer or other person, any opposite party may app
ly for an order allowing him to deliver interrogato
ries 
to any member or officer of such corporation or bod
y, and an order may be made accordingly. 
6. Objections to interrogatories by answer.—
Any
 
objection to answering any interrogatory on the 
ground that it is scandalous or irrelevant or not e

other ground], may be taken in the affidavit in ans
wer.

cts to produce, and on what ground. Such notice sha
ll

s as circumstances may require. 
18. Order for inspection.—
(
1
) Where the party served with notice rule 15 omits 
to give such notice 
of a time for inspection or objects to give inspect
ion, or offers inspection elsewhere than at the off
ice of 
his pleader, the Court may, on the application of t
he party desiring it, make an order for inspection 
in such 
place and in such manner as it may think fit: Provi
ded that the order shall not be made when and so fa
r as 
the  Court  shall  be  of  opinion  that  it  is  not  necess
ary  either  for  disposing  fairly  of  the  suit  or  for 
saving 
costs.

2
) Any application to inspect documents, except such
 as are referred to in the pleadings, particulars 
or affidavit of the party against whom the applicat
ion is made or disclosed in his affidavit of docume
nts, 
shall  be  founded  upon  an  affidavit  showing  of  what 
documents  inspection  is  sought,  that  the  party 
applying is entitled to inspect them, and that they
 are in the possession or power of the other party.
 The

opinion that it is not necessary either for disposi
ng fairly of the suit or for saving costs. 
19. Verified copies.—
(
1
) Where inspection of any business books is applied
 for, the Court may, if it 
thinks  fit,  instead  of  ordering  inspection  of  the  o
riginal  books,  order  a  copy  of  any  entries  therein 
to  be 
furnished  and  verified  by  the  affidavit  of  some  per
son  who  has  examined  the  copy  with  the  original 
entries, and such affidavit shall state whether or 
not there are in the original book any and what era
sures, 
interlineations or alterations: Provided that, notw
ithstanding that such copy has been supplied, the C
ourt 
may order inspection of the book from which the cop
y was made. 
(
2
) Where on an application for an order for inspecti
on privilege is claimed for any document, it shall 
be lawful for the Court to inspect the document for
 the purpose of deciding as to the validity of the 
claim 
of privilege 
1
[unless the document relates to matters of State.] 
(
3
) The Court may, on the application of any party to
 suit at any time, and whether an affidavit of 
documents  shall  or  shall  not  have  already  been  orde
red  or  made,  make  an  order  requiring  any  other 
party  to  state  by  affidavit  whether  any  one  or  more
  specific  documents,  to  be  specified  in  the 
application, is or are, or has or have at any time 
been, in his possession or power; and, if not then 
in 
his possession, when he parted with the same and wh
at has become thereof. Such application shall be 
made on an affidavit stating that in the belief of 
the deponent the party against whom the application
 
is made has, or has at some time had in his possess
ion or power the document or documents specified 
in the application, and that they relate to the mat
ters in question in the suit, or to some of them. 
20
. 
Premature  discovery.—
Where
 
the  party  from  whom  discovery  of  any  kind  or  inspec
tion  is 
sought objects to the same, or any part thereof, th
e Court may, if satisfied that the right to the dis
covery or 
inspection sought depends on the determination of a
ny issue or question in dispute in the suit, or tha
t for 
any  other  reason  it  is  desirable  that  any  issue  or 
question  in  dispute  in  the  suit  should  be  determine
d 
before  deciding  upon  the  right  to  the  discovery  or 
inspection,  order  that  such  issue  or  question  be 
determined first, and reserve the question as to th
e discovery or inspection. 
21. Non-compliance with order for discovery.—

[(
1
)] Where any party fails to comply with any order t
o 
answer interrogatories, or for discovery or inspect
ion of documents, he shall, if a plaintiff, be liab
le to have his 
suit dismissed for want of prosecution, and, if a d
efendant, to have his defence, if any struck out, a

ORDER XIV 
S
ettlement of Issues and Determination of Suit on  
Issues of Law or on Issues agreed upon 
1. Framing of issues.—
(
1
) Issues arise when a material proposition of fact 
or law is affirmed by the 
one party and denied by the other. 
(
2
)
 
Material propositions arc those propositions of law
 or fact which a plaintiff must allege in order to 
show a right to sue or a defendant must allege in o
rder to constitute his defence. 
(
3
) Each material proposition affirmed by one party a
nd denied by the other shall form the subject of 
distinct issue. 
(
4
) Issues are of two kinds: 
(
a
)
 
issues of fact, 
(
b
)
 
issues of law.
 
(
5
) At the first hearing of the suit the Court shall,
 after reading the plaint and the written statement
s if 
any,  and 
1
[after  examination  under  rule  2  of  Order  X  and  afte
r  hearing  the  parties  or  their  pleaders], 
ascertain upon what material propositions of fact o
r of law the parties are at variance, and shall the
reupon 
proceed to frame and record the issues on which the
 right decision of the case appears to depend. 
(
6
) Nothing is this rule requires the Court to frame 
and record issued where the defendant at the first 
hearing of the suit makes no defence. 
2
[2. Court to pronounce judgment on all issues.—
(
1
)
 
Notwithstanding that a case may be disposed 
of  on  a  preliminary  issue,  the  Court shall,  subject
 to the  provisions  of  sub-rule  (
2
),  pronounce judgment 
on all issues. 
(
2
) Where issues both of law and of fact arise in the
 same suit, and the Court is of opinion that the ca
se or 
any part thereof may be disposed of on an issue of 
law only, it may try that issue first if the issue 
relates to— 
(
a
) the jurisdiction of the Court, or 
 (
b
) a bar to the suit created by any law for the time
 being in force, 
and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, postpon
e the settlement of the other issues until after th
at issue 
has been determined, and may deal with the suit in 
accordance with the decision on that issue.] 
3. Materials from which issues may be framed.—
The
 
Court may frame the issues from all or any 
of the following materials:— 
(
a
)
 
allegations made on oath by the parties, or by any 
persons present on their behalf, or made by 
the pleaders of such parties; 
(
b
) allegations made in the pleadings or in answers t
o interrogatories delivered in the suit; 
(
c
) the contents of documents produced by either part
y. 
4.  Court  may  examine  witnesses  or  documents  before 
framing  issues.—
Where
 
the  Court  is  of 
opinion that the issues cannot be correctly framed 
without the examination of some person not before t
he 
Court or without the inspection of some document no
t
,
 produced in the suit, it 
3
[may adjourn the framing 
of  issues  to  a  day  not  later  than  seven  days]  and  m
ay  (subject  to  any  law  for  the  time  being  in  force)
 
compel  the  attendance  of  any  person  or  the  producti
on  of  any  document  by  the  person  in  whose 
possession or power it is by summons or other proce
ss. 
4
[
5.
 
Power to amend and strike out, issues.—
(
1
) The Court may at any time before passing a decree
 
amend  the  issues  or  frame  additional  issues  on  such
  terms  as  it  thinks  fit,  and  all  such  amendments  or
 
additional issues as may be necessary for determini
ng the matters in controversy between the parties s
hall 
be so made or framed.

rds (w.e.f. 1-2-1977).

s (w.e.f. 1-7-2002). 
4. Subs. by Act 22 of 2002, s. 11, for rule 5 (w.e.
f. 1-7-2002).
 


112 
(
2
) The Court may also, at any time before passing a 
decree, strike out any issues that appear to it to 
be wrongly framed or introduced.] 
6. Questions of fact or law may by agreement be sta
ted in form of issues.—
(
1
) Where the parties 
to  a  suit  are  agreed  as  to  the  question  of  fact  or 
of  law  to  be  decided  between  them,  they  may  state  t
he 
same in the form of an issue, and enter into an agr
eement in writing that, upon the finding of the Cou
rt in 
the affirmative or the negative or such issue,— 
(
a
)  a  sum  of  money  specified  in  the  agreement  or  to  b
e  ascertained  by  the  Court,  or  in  such 
manner as the Court may direct, shall be paid by on
e of the parties to the other of them, or that one 
of 
them be declared entitled to some right or subject 
some liability specified in the agreement; 
(
b
) some property specified in the agreement and in d
ispute in the suit shall be delivered by one 
of the parties to the other of them, or as that oth
er may direct; or 
(
c
) one or more of the parties shall do or abstain fr
om doing some particular act specified in the 
agreement and relating to the matter in dispute. 
7.
 
Court,  if  satisfied  that  agreement  was  executed  in 
good  faith,  may  pronounce  judgment.— 
Where the Court is satisfied, after making such inq
uiry as it deems proper,—  
(
a
) that the agreement was duly executed by the parti
es, 
(
b
) that they have a substantial interest in the deci
sion of such question as aforesaid, and 
(
c
) that the same is fit to be tried and decided, 
it shall proceed to record and try the issue and st
ate its finding or decision thereon in the same man
ner as 
if the issue had been framed by the Court; 
and shall, upon the finding or decision on such iss
ue, pronounce judgment according to the terms of 
the agreement; and, upon the judgment so pronounced
, a decree shall follow.

here is some inaccuracy as to the amount referred t
o

2
) of rule 11, the Court shall, instead of rejecting
 the application, decide 
provisionally (without prejudice to the right of th
e parties to have the amount finally decided in the

—(
1
)  Where  applications  are  made  to  a  Court  for  the

 entered upon both decrees; and 
(
b
) if the two sums are unequal execution may be take
n out only by the holder of the decree for 
the larger sum and for so much only as remains afte
r deducting the smaller sum, and satisfaction for 
the smaller sum shall be entered on the decree for 
the larger sum as well as satisfaction on the decre
e 
for the smaller sum.

al assignor as in respect of judgment-debts due by 
the 
assignee himself. 
(
3
) This rule shall not be deemed to apply unless—  
(
a
)  the  decree-holder  in  one  of  the  suits  in  which  th
e  decrees  have  been  made  is  the  judgment-
debtor in the other and each party files the same c
haracter in both suits; and 
(

) A holds a decree against B for Rs. 1,000. B holds
 a decree against A for payment of Rs. 1,000 in cas
e A fails

treat his decree as a cross-decree under this rule.
 
(
b
) A and B, co-plaintiffs, obtain a decree for Rs. 1
,000. against C, and C obtains a decree for Rs. 1,0
00 against 
B. C cannot treat his decree as a cross-decree unde
r this rule. 
A obtains a decree against B for Rs. 1,000. C, who 
is a trustee for B, obtains a decree on behalf of B
 against A 
for Rs. 1,000. B cannot treat C's decree as a cross
-decree under this rule. 
A, B, C, D and E are jointly and severally liable f
or Rs. 1,000 under a decree obtained by F. A obtain
s a decree 
for Rs. 1,000 against F singly and applies for exec

cree.

for  the  execution  of  a  decree  under  which  two  parti
es  are  entitled  to  recover  sums  of  money  from  each 
other, then—  
(
a
) if the two sums are equal, satisfaction for both 
shall be entered upon the decree; and 
(
b
)  if  the  two  sums  are  unequal,  execution  may  be  tak
en  out  only  by  the  party  entitled  to  the  larger 
sum and for so much only as remains after deducting
 the smaller sum, and satisfaction for the smaller 
sum 
shall be entered upon the decree.

o preclude the Court from issuing any process 
in  execution  of  a  decree  without  issuing  the  notice
  thereby  prescribed,  if,  for  reasons  to  be  recorded

considers  that  the  issue  of  such  notice  would  cause
  unreasonable  delay  or  would  defeat  the  ends  of 
justice.

ailure  of  the  decree-holder  to  substitute  the  legal
 
representative of such deceased judgment-debtor, bu

if it is satisfied that the legal representative of
 the deceased judgment-debtor has been prejudiced b

)
 
Where the person to whom notice is issued under

[
Explanation.—
For
 
the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that t
he expression “the act required 
to be done” covers prohibitory as well as mandatory
 injunctions.]
 
Illustration 
A, a person of little substance, erects a building 
which renders uninhabitable a family mansion belong
ing to B. 
A, in spite of  his detention in prison and the atta
chment of  his property, declines to obey a decree o
btained against 
him by B and directing him to remove the building. 
The Court is of opinion that no sum realizable by t
he sale of A's 
property would adequately compensate B for the depr
eciation in the value of his mansion. B may apply t
o the Court 
to remove the building and may recover the cost of 
such removal from A in the execution-proceedings. 
33.   Discretion   of   Court   in   executing   decrees   for   re

e  fixed  in  this  behalf,  the  judgment-debtor  shall 
make  to  the  decree-holder  such  periodical  payments 
as  may  be  just,  and,  if  it  thinks  fit,  require  that
  the 
judgment-debtor shall, to its satisfaction, secure 
to the decree-holder such periodical payments. 
(
3
) The Court may from time to time vary or modify an
y order made under sub-rule (2)
 
for the periodical 
payment of money, either by altering the times of p
ayment or by increasing or diminishing the amount, 
or may

country  to  withdraw,  remove  or  open  any  lock  or  bol

such appearance shall be given by the defendant 
to  the  plaintiff’s  pleader,  or,  if  the  plaintiff  su

udgment-debtors  above-named  as  mentioned  in  the 
schedule  below;  and  the  liabilities  and  claims  atta
ching  to  the  said  property,  so  far  as  they  have  bee

At the sale the public generally are invited to bid
, either personally or by duly authorized agent. No

by, or on behalf of, the judgment-creditors above-m
entioned, however, will be accepted, nor will any s
ale to

 Court previously given. The following are the furt
her. 
Conditions of sale 
1. The particulars specified in the schedule below 
have been stated to the best of the information of 
the 
Court, but the Court will not be answerable for any
 error, mis-statement or omission in this proclamat
ion. 
2.  The  amount  by  which  the  biddings  are  to  be  incre
ased  shall  be  determined  by  the  officer 
conducting  the  sale.  In  the event  of any  dispute ar
ising  as  to  the  amount  bid,  or as  to  the  bidder,  th
e  lot 
shall at once be again put up to auction. 
3.  The  highest  bidder  shall  be  declared  to  be  the  p
urchaser  of  any  lot,  provided  always  that  he  is 
legally qualified to bid, and provided that it shal
l be in the discretion of the Court or officer hold
ing the 
sale  to  decline  acceptance  of  the  highest  bid  when 
the  price  offered  appears  so  clearly  inadequate  as 
to 
make it advisable to do so. 
4.  For  reasons  recorded,  it  shall  be  in  the  discret
ion  of  the  officer  conducting  the  sale  to  adjourn  i
t 
subject always to the provisions of rule 69 of Orde
r XXI. 


285 
 
5.  In  the  case  of  movable  property,  the  price  of  ea
ch  lot  shall  be  paid  at the  time  of  sale  or  as  soon
 
after as the officer holding the sale directs, and 
in default of payment the property shall forthwith 
be again 
put up and re-sold. 
6. In the case of immovable property, the person de
clared to be the purchaser shall pay immediately 
after  such  declaration  a  deposit  of  25  per  cent.  on
  the  amount  of  his  purchase-money  to  the  officer 
conducting  the  sale,  and  in  default  of  such  deposit
  the  property  shall  forthwith  be  put  up  again  and  
         
re-sold. 
7. The full amount of the purchase-money shall be p
aid by the purchaser before the Court closes on 
the fifteenth day after the sale of the property, e
xclusive of such day, or if the fifteenth day be a 
Sunday or 
other holiday, then on the first office day after t
he fifteenth day. 
8.  In  default  of  payment  of  the  balance  of  purchase
-money  within  the  period  allowed,  the  property 
shall be re-sold after the issue of a fresh notific
ation of sale. The deposit, after defraying the exp
enses of 
the sale, may, if the Court thinks fit, be forfeite
d to Government and the defaulting purchaser shall 
forfeit 
all claim to the property or to any part of the sum
 for which it may be subsequently sold.
